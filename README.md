Deliverables:
1. Design a third-normal form database to store the needed information appropriately.
2. Design an interface to let parties open a password protected account with personal details, including
    phone number, address and email.
3. Design am interface that can only be accessed by the valid users to post items and request a trade.
4. Design a user dashboard in which they will be able to see the items that have posted for trade, items
    that are under active transaction, and items that have completed an exchange request.
5. Develop a dashboard for the admin that will manage the user accounts, approve the accounts,
    suspend them or completely delete them.
6. In the admin dashboard show all the transactions that can be ordered based on any column values
    just by clicking on the column header. Show transaction number, items exchanged, parties involved,
    data transactions started and ended, and the hash key. Also show the current summary of the costs
    collected from all the transactions cumulatively and individually for each transaction.
